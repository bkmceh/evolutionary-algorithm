# How to start algorithms
## First main algorithm
To start main algorithm, go to *Main.java* and write the path to image and number of generations.

Then create object of *EvolutionaryAlgorithm* class and call *startAlgorithm()* method.  

Result will be save in directory of the *savePictures()* method of the *EvolutionaryAlgorithm* class 

By default directory for save picture is *./images/output_image/* 

It will be created if it does not exist.


## Second algorithm
This algorithm just by fun and it try to draw image uses by icons of popularity apps.

To run this algorithm go to *SecondAlgorithm* class, find *main()* method and run it.

The icons for drawing locate in directory *./base/15*
